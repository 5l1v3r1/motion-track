##### Raspberry (Pi) - python opencv2 motion tracking using picamera module

This is a raspberry pi python opencv2 motion tracking demonstration program.
It will detect motion in the field of view and use opencv to calculate the
largest contour and return its x,y coordinate.  I will be using this for
a simple RPI robotics project, but thought the code would be useful for 
other users as a starting point for a project.  I did quite a bit of 
searching on the internet, github, etc but could not find a similar
implementation that returns x,y coordinates of the most dominate moving 
object in the frame.  Some of this code is base on a YouTube tutorial by
Kyle Hounslow using C here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6rPdRZzgjg

Here is my YouTube video demonstrating this python program using a 
Raspberry Pi B2.
